# My Portfolio Website Version 2

This is my 2nd portfolio website. The portfolio website is mainly divided into 5 sections:
01) The first section is the landing page itself which displayes my name, a 2 liner introduction about myself, my resume and my github and stackoverflow profile link.
02) The second section is named `Skills` which displays all my skillset in different domain of coding.
03) The third section is named `Works` which displays mainly all the projects that I have developed so far.
04) The fourth section is about my `Achievements`.
05) The fifth and the last section is named `Connect` where a basic form is displayed and beneath the form, a text `Click HERE to email me directly` is present. User can either use the contact form to connect
with me or the user can click on `HERE` of the text `Click HERE to email me directly` to directly email me in my email address. All the details entered by the user in the form is stored in Firebase.
